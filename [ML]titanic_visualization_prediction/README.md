## Titanic

I did this notebook to create a simple solution to the Titanic problem and visualize its data and also a way to show how to structure the machine learning solution development process. This solution is in the top 10% of the challenge.

### Description from Kaggle

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
